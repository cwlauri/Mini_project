# Mini_project

# The mini project program is in the Final_program folder, where the program is exicuted from the main.py file, and all the rest of the files are functions that are used # in the main program. A camera whcih is located above the workspace where the DUPLO blocks are places, has to be conneceted. Then Final_program folder has to placed on # the dekstop, and the file path has to be corrected. A discribstion of all the functions are in the individual function scrips. 
# The whole RoboDk code that controls the ur5 robot, is found in the Robodk file. In the file the script for that moves the robodk and the expiriment set up can also be # found.
