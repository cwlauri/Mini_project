# Mini_project

# The mini-project program is in the Final_program folder, where the program is executed from the main.py file, and all the rest of the files are functions used in the main program. A camera located above the workspace where the DUPLO bricks are must be connected. Then Final_program folder has to be placed on the desktop, and the file path must be corrected. A description of all the functions is in the individual function scrips.
# The RoboDk code that controls the ur5 robot is found in the Robodk file. The script that moves the Robodk and the experiment setup can also be found in the file. This file has to be downloaded and opened in RoboDk.
